###########PROBLEM STATEMENT#########

Hyperspectral Based GIS:

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that analyzes a wide spectrum of light instead of
just assigning primary colors (red, green, blue) to each pixel. The light striking each pixel is
broken down into many different spectral bands in order to provide more information on what
is imaged.

Input: Provided hyperspectral Image
Data can be downloaded from: PURR - Publications: 220 Band AVIRIS
Hyperspectral Image Data Set: June 12, 1992 Indian Pine Test Site 3 (purdue.edu)
You can download the dataset from: aviris_hyperspectral_data/19920612_AVIRIS_IndianPine_NS-line.tif

Deliverable: Try to do classification of area into different land types with the help of LULC
(i.e., Urban land, Barren Land, Vegetation, Water Body, Open Area) using unsupervised /
supervised classification, you should use coding for this problem.
Outcome: Distribution map of the area into different land types. Your map should contain at
least direction, scale and legend. You can use QGIS to create map.
Hint: Follow the lecture on hyperspectral related to how you can handle datacube
